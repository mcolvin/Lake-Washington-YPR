# Introduction

Output controls like bag and length limits are common tools used to prevent overfishing and manage the size structure of inland freshwater fish populations. They are often used to meet management objectives including: harvest objectives (i.e., subsistence, deep hooking, catch-and-release, trophy fisheries), harvest regulations simplicity, and size structure to minimize harvest of large fish. Preventing growth and recruitment overfishing is often one of the main management goals in both commercial and recreational fisheries (Allen et al 2013). Bag and length limits are also used to alter population size structure. For example, a study of Bluegill populations in Wisconsin found that reducing the bag limit (from 25 to 10), the mean size of Bluegill increased by an average of 20.3 mm (Rypel 2015). Another study evaluated the effects of a 200-mm minimum length limit (MLL) across 18 Bluegill populations and found that there was a small increase in size structure, when exploitation levels were held the same. Results of that study also found that populations with the lowest natural mortality and fastest growth showed the largest increase in size structure as well as the lowest reduction in yield and number of fish harvested (Paukert and Willis 2002).

Black Crappie _Pomoxis nigromaculatus_ and White Crappie _Pomoxis annularis_ are popular and important sport fish (Sammons et al. 2002), as many anglers cite crappie as first or second in angler preference (McDonough and Buchanan 1991; Mitzner 1991). Minimum length limits (MLL) are a necessary management tool to prevent overharvest or to meet angler demands for larger fish in the system due to increased fishing pressure and angler success (Boxrucker 2002; Hale et al. 1999). The use of a MLL in crappie fisheries, based on yield per recruit models, could improve both yield and average weight, but only if growth is rapid and natural mortality is low (Allen xxxx). Conversely, crappie population yield will potentially decrease when growth is slower and natural mortality increases (Miranda and Allen 1995).

In an attempt to simplify regulations and promote the harvest of smaller fish, Florida anglers are allowed to harvest 5 Largemouth Bass _Micropterus salmoides_ daily, though only 1 may be greater than 16 inches (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission). Anglers are allowed to harvest 5 bass _Micropterus_ spp. from Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia however; only 2 of the 5 may be less than 14 inches (Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries). In Minnesota, anglers can harvest up to 6 Walleye _Sander vitreus_ and Sauger _Sander canadensis_ combined, with not more than one Walleye over 20 inches (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources).

Harvest of fish below a minimum length limit is to meet varying fisheries management objectives. These objectives can include: subsistence fishing, trophy fish, harvest of fish unlikely to survive (i.e., deep-hooked fish), catch-and-release of trophy fish, or to limit harvest of larger females that are reproductively valuable to the fishery. The site of our study, Lake Washington, allows the harvest of 5 crappie under the MLL to provide subsistence angling opportunities and allow the harvest of deep hooked fish. Another example of exceptions to the length limits is for Rainbow Trout _Oncorhynchus mykiss_ in Pend Oreille Lake, Idaho, where harvest is limited to 2 fish with 1 exceeding 20 inches, in order to promote a trophy fishery (M. Corsi Idaho Fish and Game, personal communication).

However, the harvest of fish below the MLL can result in conflict among angler groups that perceive that harvest of fish under the MLL is causing population and size structure declines. Lake Washington, a Mississippi River oxbow lake, is a well-known for producing both large number of fish and trophy sized Crappie, and is a popular fishing destination for recreational, tournament, and subsistence anglers (cite). Since many of the local anglers are fishing for subsistence, the &quot;5 under rule&quot; was put in place. This regulation allows the harvest of 5 crappie under the MLL of 254 mm. In 2015, a petition was signed by 595 anglers calling for an increase in the MLL, and to drop the &quot;5 under rule&quot;. Anglers who signed the petition, cited the main reason for wanting new regulations was a perceived decline in harvest rates and average weights in recent years with increased fishing pressure. However, monitoring data did not show an obvious decline or change in relative abundance, angler catch, or size structure (N. Aycock unpublished data). The department wanted to evaluate the effects on yield at 3 different MLLs of 254 mm (the MLL during the study period), 279.4 mm, and 304.8 mm (MLL proposed by anglers).

Crappie are often fished for as one species, and therefore managed as one species. A Beverton-Holt yield per recruit model (YPR) can be used for assessing effect of varying length limits, however the model is only evaluates harvest above the LL or between two lengths and predicts yield for a single cohort. In this study, used a modified Beverton-Holt YPR that evaluates harvest occurring below and above the MLL and also accounted for species specific differences. Therefore, the specific objectives of this study were to develop a yield per recruit model that accounts for harvest occurring below the MLL, and use the model to evaluate effects of a 254, 279.4, and 304.8 mm MLL on growth and recruitment overfishing of White and Black Crappie (hereafter crappie) in Lake Washington.

# Methods

## Study Area

The study took place on Lake Washington, in Washington County, Mississippi (33.0773N, 91.0466W). Lake Washington is an oxbow lake of the Mississippi River and one of the largest natural lakes in the state (2,023 ha). Lake depth averages 1.8 meters maximum depth is 6.7 m. Lake Washington is well known for its crappie fishing and is a popular fishing destination. Sportfish found in the lake include Largemouth Bass _Micropterus salmoides_, Bluegill _Lepomis macrochirus_, Channel Catfish _Ictalurus punctatus_, Black Crappie _Pomoxis nigromaculatus_, and White Crappie _Pomoxis annularis_. Black and White Crappie (hereafter crappie refers to Black and White Crappie collectively) are fished for as one species in this system, and in turn, are managed as one species. During this study crappie harvest was regulated with a 254 mm MLL and a daily bag limit of 30 fish of which anglers are allowed to keep 5 fish under the MLL.

## Yield Per recruit and spawning potential ratio

Traditionally, YPR models only account for yield occurring above a MLL or between two limits (i.e., slot limit). Since Lake Washington has a regulation allowing for harvest of 5 crappie under the MLL we modified the YPR model used by Colvin et al. (2013). Specifically, the model was modified to evaluate Black and White Crappie collectively and allow fishing mortality to occur below the minimum length limit and species specific inputs. This model required the same information as a typical YPR model, including: 1) species composition, sex ratio, and maximum age, 2) mortality rates (natural, fishing, total), 3) age-length relationships,4) length-weight relationships, and 5) length-fecundity and sexual maturity relationships. When possible, data was collected to estimate the inputs and are described below.

## Fish and Fishery Data

Crappie were captured as part of MDWFP standardized monitoring effort {Mirandaâ€¦} in the fall. Fish sampling was conducted on October 4, 2015 â€&quot; October 6, 2015. Trap and lead nets were set nightly at twelve different locations in Lake Washington and tended the next day. The trap nets are constructed of two 3 foot x 6 foot x 1 inch fiberglass frames, with four 2.5 foot diameter hoops in the fiberglass. Hoops are 2 feet apart. The netting is square knotless treated nylon with 0.5 inch openings. The trap nets are 40 feet in length, 3 feet in depth, and attached to the first frame. The lead nets that we used were constructed with two hoops facing each other, and are connected with a lead that attaches to each hoop net. The net and lead are constructed from 1 inch treated bar mesh. The hoops are constructed of 7 fiberglass hoops, with a diameter of 3.5 feet, which are separated by 2 feet with throats located at the 2nd and 4th hoop. The lead between the two hoops nets is 30 feet in length. Captured fish were identified to species and total length recorded to the nearest mm. The first 5 crappie caught from each centimeter group were kept and weighed to the nearest g within 24h and saggital otoliths removed to estimate age. Two independent reviewers without prior knowledge of fish length estimated age for each crappie. Estimated ages were compared between readers and if disagreement occurred, the otolith was reviewed together until a consensus was reached.

## Age-length and length-weight relationships

We used crappie retained for weight and aging to estimate age-length and length-weight relationships to use the in the YPR. Because of potential growth difference between species we fit age-length and length-weight models that allowed for species differences and ones that did not and then selected the best model using Akaike&#39;s Information Criteria (AIC) [cite]. We fit 3 vonBertalanffy growth functions to age-length data representing no species difference and an effect of species on growth. Because the data was collected by binning (i.e., age length key) we weighed each observation by the length frequency distribution of the total catch (Chih 2009). We then fit 3 length-weight models to the data, one that assumed there was no difference between species, another that allowed the intercept to vary between species and lastly a model that allowed intercept and slope to vary between species.

## Mortality and exploitation

Total mortality ($Z$) was estimated by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks in 2012 and this estimate used in this study. In brief, captured fish were aged and a weighted catch curve was used to estimate $Z$. A tag return study was conducted in 2014-2015 to estimate annual exploitation rate. In that study, 400 fish greater than the MLL (\&gt;254 mm) were tagged and a reward was given out for each returned tags. Annual exploitation was then estimated accounting for tagging mortality, non-reporting, and tag loss. Mortality and exploitation rates used in this analysis are in Table 1.

## Analysis

The framework provided in Colvin et al 2013 allowed flexibility in YPR model inputs allowing us to account for model uncertainty. For example, there are multiple models in addition to the vonBertallanffy growth function that can be used to predict length from age (Greek dudes paper). Additionally, the effect of species can be included in competing growth models thereby allowing the potential for species specific inputs. Further details are provided below.

Crappie yield was calculated, assuming Crappie recruit to the population at age-1, as

$Y=i=12t=1i[C(t)iW(t)i]dt$  (1)

where $c(t)i$ was the age-specific catch, $W(t)i$ was the weight at age,$i$ was the maximum age, and $i$ indexed species. Equation 1 was numerically integrated given inputs described below to calculate yield for weight at age and catch at age equations {Colvin, 2013 #4635}. Catch at age

We modeled catch as the age-specific product of fishing mortality and natural mortality as

$C(t)i=F(t)Rie-(Mtr,i)e-(M+F(t))(tr,i-tb,i)  e-(M+F(t))(t-tr,i)$, (2)

where $F(t)i$ was the age specific fishing mortality, $R\_i$ was the species specific number of fish recruited to the cohort, $Mi$ was the instantaneous natural mortality rate,  was the age that a fish recruits to the fishery, $t\_{b,i}$ was the age a fish recruited to the entire fishery, $t$ was age, and $i$ indexed species. Fishing mortality varied with age as

## Overfishing analysis

We used the YPR model to evaluate 3 proposed MLL, 254 mm, 279.4 mm, and 304.80; varying fishing mortalities below the MLL (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) and exploitation rates above the MLL from 0 to 0.9 in increments of 0.05. By evaluating various fishing mortality below the MLL we were able to evaluate the potential effect of fishing mortality below the MLL, while still evaluating that effect that different length limits would have on yield in the system. This would also allow us to see when, if at all, growth overfishing could occur in the system. Once the required information: length-weight relationship, the VBGF, and annual exploitation were calculated we were able to simulate 5 different Yield per Recruit models, each assessing a different conditional fishing mortality below the MLL and the three options for the proposed length limit; 254, 279.4, 304.8 mm. We visually assessed the fishery for the potential for growth overfishing, by looking for decline in yield with increased effort.

### SPR

# Results

We captured 478 crappie, 360 Black Crappie and 118 White Crappie. Of the crappie caught, 154 Black Crappie and 62 White Crappie were retained and used to fit age-length and length-weight models. Size structure varied between Black and White Crappie and total length varied from 105 to 359 mm and 100 to 364 mm respectively (Table 1).

## Predictive relationships

Length-weight \* strong evidence for difference between species (intercept and slope), competing models were 6 or more AIC points away

1. no species difference: AIC= -226.1
2. intercept varies by species: AIC= -260.1
3. intercept and slope varies between species: AIC= -266.0

Age-length Length-fecundity

## Yield per Recruit analysis

### Growth overfishing

For each scenario, the current MLL of 254 mm had the greatest yield at the 41% exploitation rate. Yield decrease in every scenario with an increased MLL. As the conditional fishing mortality below the MLL increases we see a shift to the right on the exploitation axis was the 254 mm length limit yield exceeds the 279.4 and 3014.8 mm length limit yield. However, for each scenario this point occurs under the 41% exploitation line that this fishery experiences.

### Recruit overfishing

Spawning potential ratios decreased with increasing exploitation and decreasing MLL.

- SPR decreased with increasing fishing mortality below the MLL
- 12&quot; offered most protection from recruit overfishing with no scenarios exceeding 0.3
- 11&quot; offered lots of protection for a range of fishing mortality and 0.3 was not exceeded until u was higher than xxx.
- 10&quot; offered some protection but it only for u values \&lt; xxxx.

# Discussion

Crappie are an important sportfish in the United States (Maceina and Stimpert 1998). They are often managed for as the same species because anglers rarely differentiate between the two species (Mitzner 1991). For this study we evaluated the two species together because under the current regulations there is no difference in length limits or bag limits for Black and White Crappie.

However, one species is often more abundant than the other in one system (Sammons et al. 2002). Assuming that Catch per Unit Effort in Lake Washington is linearly related to abundance, it indicates that there is more Black Crappie than White Crappie in the system. However, there is data that suggests that there may be a bias for Black Crappie when using trap nets, resulting in more Black Crappie being sampled that white crappie when relying solely on trap style nets for catch data (Sammons et al. 2002). It is also is shown that electrofishing may be more effective in capturing larger fish needed to obtain age and growth data, and that trap nets may be biased to smaller, younger fish (Sammons et al. 2002).

Electrofishing in the spring could be done to add data, and improve the yield per recruit models. In our study, the mean length and weight was greater for Black Crappie than White Crappie.

The mean age of White Crappie captured was also lower than the mean age of Black Crappie captured. This could suggest that trap nets are biased to capturing more Black Crappie, and that some electrofishing may also be needed to sample the larger fish in the system.

Length limits have become increasingly popular ways on managing to meet angler demands of larger fish in the system. In many systems, harvest numbers, not larger sized fish, is of more importance to crappie anglers (Hale et all 1999). Lake Washington may be unique in that some anglers are specially seeking the larger trophy sized fish, yet others are seeking large numbers of fish harvested (N. Aycock, unpublished data). In a study by Hale et al. (1999), a 254 mm length limit was imposed on the Delaware Reservoir to increase size of crappie caught without greatly reducing harvest numbers. The length limit was successful in increasing the mean size of fish caught, but it did dramatically decrease annual yield. However, improvements to fisheries are specific to the study area and are susceptible to fluctuating year class strength (Webb and Ott 1991).

In this study we noted that in every scenario presented yield would most likely decrease with an increased MLL. However, by increasing the length limit, the mean size of fish harvested would most likely increase. Keeping the â€œ5 under ruleâ€ in place would still allow for the harvest of fish below the MLL, allowing anglers to still keep a 254 mm if, if the MLL length limit was increased.

Miranda and Allen (1995) suggest that reducing exploitation by the use of harvest restrictions does not always improve yield. They found that yield is only likely to increase due to harvest restrictions when growth is fast and natural mortality is low. However, their model does suggest that decreasing annual exploitation, or restricting harvest, can increase the average weight of fish caught, but only when growth is fast and natural mortality is low. According to the models outlined in their paper the population in Lake Washington is a ??? growing population with (high/low natural mortality). Another issue often associated with managing crappie populations is how variable recruitment into crappie populations is. This may affect the estimate of total annual mortality of the population. A catch curve analysis was used to estimate our annual mortality; this method assumes that there is constant recruitment into the population (Allen 1997). Crappie populations have been shown to experience variability in recruitment to age-1 (McDonough and Buchanan 1991; Webb and Ott 1991: Mitzner 1995). Our models do not take into account variable annual mortality rates, and yield from year to year will most likely fluctuate with fluctuating recruitment.

White Crappie are thought to grow faster than Black Crappie due to their piscivorous diet (Ellison 1984). In a 2002 study, Sammons et al. found data that supported this conclusion. They found that by age 4, Black Crappie were on average 30 mm smaller than White Crappie. Variability in size at the same age could affect the age at which one of the species is affected by the MLL. If White Crappie are reaching the MLL before Black Crappie, and are less abundant that Black Crappie in the system, catch rates could be potentially affected.

- Blacks versus whites and justification for combining, CPUE suggests they are a small component of Crappie stock, But there could be some habitat segregation (any papers documenting different growth? Different mortality rates?)
- Effect of increasing MLL ? increased opportunities to harvest 5 under because more fish from 8? 12â€ versus 8? 10â€, Creel indicates 8â€ over is harvested (N. Aycock Unpublished data)
