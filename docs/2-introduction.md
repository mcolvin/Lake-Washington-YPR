## Introduction

### Fishery importance

- broader inland fishery for recreation and subsistence


### Crappie as an example

Black crappie _Pomoxis nigromaculatus_ and white crappie _Pomoxis annularis_ are popular and 
 economically important North American sport fish.
Many anglers often cite crappie as first or second in angler preference (McDonough and Buchanan 1991;
 Mitzner 1991).
- subsistance

### Crappie Management using length limits
 
Due to increased fishing pressure and angler success minimum length limits (MLL) have become a necessary
 management tool to prevent overharvest and to meet angler demands for larger fish in the system
 (Boxrucker 2002; Hale et al. 1999).
The use of harvest restrictions can help improve harvest only if growth is fast and natural mortality
 is low.
Conversely, crappie population yield will potentially decrease when growth is slower and natural
 mortality increases (Miranda and Allen 1995).  
- Deep hooking, subsistence, harvest opportunity


### The problem

- frame in delta, poor subsistence but also trophy crappie, conflicting management, harvest below
 mll, deep hooking, subsistence, so on. 
Lake Washington is well known for the number of crappie caught, as well as, producing trophy sized fish.
It is a very popular crappie fishery for recreational, tournament, as well as subsistence anglers.
Since many local anglers are fishing for subsistence, a unique rule for the system, the “5 under rule”,
 was put in place.
This rule allows anglers to keep up to 5 fish under the current MLL of 254 mm a day.
When surveyed, most anglers said that they would be a fish that was 8 inches or greater (N.Aycock,
 unpublished data).
We were unable to find any scientific data that suggest what effect this type of rule may have on yields.

### Evaluating MLL with harvest ocurring below MLL

* YPR does not do this, at least as implement in FAST/FAMS that use the jones approximation
* Some have done catch & release on ypr {cite}
* Colvin et al. set up how to easily handle complex equilibrium ypr


### Closing and objectives

In 2015, a petition was signed by 595 anglers that called for an increase in the Minimum Length Limit (MLL) and to drop the
 “5 under rule”.
Anglers who signed this petition gave the primary reason for wanting a new regulation was that harvest rates and average
 weights had decreased in recent years with increased fishing pressure.
Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Park wanted to evaluate the effects on yield of MLL of 254, 279.4, or
 304.8 millimeter MLL.
By evaluating different MLL and varying harvest below the MLL the department would have the necessary data in order to
 propose a new regulation if needed.
In order to establish a yield per recruit model, needed to evaluate the population, we would need to collect or estimate
 length-weight relationship, a growth curve and mortality.
Traditionally a Beverton-Holt yield per recruit models (YPR) only take into account harvest above the MLL, but for this
 study we modified this traditional YPR model to be able to evaluate harvest below the MLL.
This let us evaluate yield per recruit for multiple mortality levels below the MLL occurring under the proposed MLLs of
 254, 279.4, or 304.8 millimeters.

 The objectives of this study were to 1) develop a yield per recruit model that accounts for harvest
 occurring below the MLL, and use the model to evaluate a 10, 11, and 12 inch MLL on growth and recruit
 overfishing.
