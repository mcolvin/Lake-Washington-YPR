Crappyie are an important sportfish in the United States 
(Maceina and Stimpert 1998). They are often managed for as the same 
species because anglers rarely differentiate between the two species 
(Mitzner 1991). For this study we evaluated the two species together 
because under the current regulations there is no difference in length 
limits or bag limits for Black and White Crappie. 

However, one species 
is often more abundant than the other in one system (Sammons et al. 
2002). Assuming that Catch per Unit Effort in Lake Washington is 
linearly related to abundance, it can be suggested that there is more 
Black Crappie than White Crappie in the system. There is data that 
suggest that there may be a bias for Black Crappie when using trap nets, 
resulting in more Black Crappie being sampled that white crappie when 
relying solely on trap style nets for catch data (Sammons et al. 2002). 
It is also is shown that electrofishing may be more effective in 
capturing larger fish needed to obtain age and growth data, and that 
trap nets may be biased to smaller, younger fish (Sammons et al. 2002). 

Electrofishing in the spring could be done to add data, and improve the 
yield per recruit models. In our study, the mean length and weight was 
greater for Black Crappie than White Crappie. 

The mean age of White 
Crappie captured was also lower than the mean age of Black Crappie 
captured. This could suggest that trap nets are biased to capturing more 
Black Crappie, and that some electrofishing may also be needed to sample 
the larger fish in the system. 

 

Length limits have become increasingly popular ways on managing to meet 
angler demands of larger fish in the system. In many systems, harvest 
numbers, not larger sized fish, is of more importance to crappie anglers 
(Hale et all 1999). Lake Washington may be unique in that some anglers 
are specially seeking the larger trophy sized fish, yet others are 
seeking large numbers of fish harvested (N. Aycock, unpublished data). 
In a study by Hale et al. (1999), a 254 mm length limit was imposed on 
the Delaware Reservoir to increase size of crappie caught without 
greatly reducing harvest numbers. The length limit was successful in 
increasing the mean size of fish caught, but it did dramatically 
decrease annual yield. However, improvements to fisheries are specific 
to the study area and are susceptible to fluctuating year class strength 
(Webb and Ott 1991). 

In this study we noted that in every scenario 
presented yield would most likely decrease with an increased MLL. 
However, by increasing the length limit, the mean size of fish harvested 
would most likely increase. Keeping the “5 under rule” in place would 
still allow for the harvest of fish below the MLL, allowing anglers to 
still keep a 254 mm if, if the MLL length limit was increased. 

	
Miranda and Allen (1995) suggest that reducing exploitation by the use 
of harvest restrictions does not always improve yield. They found that 
yield is only likely to increase due to harvest restrictions when growth 
is fast and natural mortality is low. However, their model does suggest 
that decreasing annual exploitation, or restricting harvest, can 
increase the average weight of fish caught, but only when growth is fast 
and natural mortality is low. According to the models outlined in their 
paper the population in Lake Washington is a ??? growing population with 
(high/low natural mortality). Another issue often associated with 
managing crappie populations is how variable recruitment into crappie 
populations is. This may affect the estimate of total annual mortality 
of the population. A catch curve analysis was used to estimate our 
annual mortality; this method assumes that there is constant recruitment 
into the population (Allen 1997). Crappie populations have been shown to 
experience variability in recruitment to age-1 (McDonough and Buchanan 
1991; Webb and Ott 1991: Mitzner 1995). Our models do not take into 
account variable annual mortality rates, and yield from year to year 
will most likely fluctuate with fluctuating recruitment. 

White Crappie are thought to grow faster than Black Crappie due to 
their piscivorous diet (Ellison 1984). In a 2002 study, Sammons et al. 
found data that supported this conclusion. They found that by age 4, 
Black Crappie were on average 30 mm smaller than White Crappie. 
Variability in size at the same age could affect the age at which one of 
the species is effected by the MLL. If White Crappie are reaching the 
MLL before Black Crappie, and are less abundant that Black Crappie in 
the system, catch rates could be potentially affected. 





* Blacks versus whites and justification for combining, CPUE suggests 
they are a small component of Crappie stock, But there could be some 
habitat segregation (any papers documenting different growth? Different 
mortality rates?) 

* Effect of increasing MLL ? increased opportunities to harvest 5 under 
because more fish from 8? 12” versus 8? 10”, Creel indicates 8” over is 
harvested (N. Aycock Unpublished data)
